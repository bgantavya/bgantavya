    //A static method in Java is a method that is part of a class rather than an instance of that class. 
    // Every instance of a class has access to the method. 
    // Static methods have access to class variables (static variables) without using the class's object (instance). 
    // Only static data may be accessed by a static method.
    //A non-static method does not have the keyword static before the name of the method. 
    // â€¢ A non-static method belongs to an object of the class 
    // and you have to create an instance of the class to access it. 
    //
