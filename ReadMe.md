# 👋 Hello, World! I'm Gantavya Bansal


## 🎓 About Me
I’m a passionate **Computer Science and Engineering** grad from **GLA University**, Mathura. From mastering the periodic table to now mastering Python and full-stack development, my journey has been a blend of science, code, and a dash of humor.

- 🌟 **5-Star Coder** on HackerRank - Yes, I do hack... but legally!
- 🎓 **CS50 Mentee** by Harvard University - Because why not learn from the best?
- 🥇 **Top 3 @Hack-D-Py** - Where caffeine meets code.
- 🧠 **Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics** background - Basically, I’m your go-to for both coding and tutoring in math and science!

## 💼 Currently Working On
### 🔥 Python Mastery 🐍
Welcome to the ultimate Python dojo, where I teach everything from basic print statements to building AI models that can (almost) predict the weather! 🌦️

- **Basic Output**: Because even "Hello, World!" deserves some love.
- **AI/ML**: Let’s make machines learn... and maybe one day, they’ll code for us.
- **Cracking**: The art of breaking down complex problems, minus the actual cracking part.
- **OOP & DSA**: Teaching you how to think like a computer... but better.
- **Competitive Programming**: Where the only thing more competitive than the code is the coder.
- **Tool Making**: Build the tools that’ll make your life easier. Automation is the future, my friend!
- **GUI Development**: Making sure your apps look good while they do good.
- **Command Line Applications**: The true test of a coder’s grit and patience.

### 🍏 NutriNudge 🍎
I'm also crafting **NutriNudge**, a full-stack web app that's like your personal AI-powered nutritionist—only it doesn't nag (much). Designed for nutritionists and clients, it features:

- **User-Based Authentication**: Because privacy is as important as those extra vitamins.
- **AI Chat**: Ask it anything, from “What’s a healthy snack?” to “How do I become a coding ninja?” 🥷
- **Automation Galore**: Saving time for both nutritionists and users, one automated task at a time.

## 🌱 I’m Currently Learning
- **Advanced Python**: Because regular Python just wasn’t challenging enough.
- **Cutting-edge frameworks**: The kind that makes you feel outdated the moment you learn them. 😅

## 🏆 Achievements & Experience
- **Organized DSA-a-thon**: Turning coding into a competitive sport, minus the sweat.
- **Maintained GlanceJob Fair Website**: Helping 200+ seniors land their dream jobs—one line of code at a time.
- **Web Design & Social Media Management**: Because making things look pretty is half the battle.
- **Contributed to GLA University’s Alumni Newsletter**: Creating content so engaging, even alumni who’ve moved on still read it.
